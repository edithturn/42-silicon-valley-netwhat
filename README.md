# Netwhat :fish: :dragon_face:
This project is an introduction to **network  problematics**.

**Netwhat** will allow you to discover the **network** and to learn about its inner workings.
This will allow you to understand how some things work that you already use in your
everyday life.

Before you start, study the section [Basic Concepts](#Basic-Concepts).  When you're ready, run the program built in python:

## Basic Concepts
## :books: :wine_glass:

### :zero::one: **What is an IP address?**
It is a network address for our computers and the internet knows where to send informations and data.
Every website (42, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) has a unique IP address, but it goes by its name instead (42, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) But without IP addresses you couldn't connect with them and they couldn't share information with you.
IP Addres is composed of:  **[ network  ]  [ host  ]**
**IP Addres Example:**
```console
66.171.248.170
```

### :zero::two: **What is a Netmask?**
A Netmask is a 32-bit **"mask"** used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.

### :zero::three: **What is the subnet of an IP with Netmask**
It is called a subnet mask because it is used to identify network address of an IP address by perfoming a bitwise AND operation on the netmask.
```console
<network> <subnet> <host>
```

### :zero::four: **What is the broadcast address of a subnet?**
Highest IP address in a subnet or network, used as the destination IP address for broadcast messages.

### :zero::five: **What are the different ways to represent an ip address with the Netmask?**

Netmask is a 32-bit "mask" used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.

Example:
```console
255.255.255.0
# Applied to
129.144.41.101
# The result is the IPv4 address of 
129.144.41.0
```
```console
129.144.41.101 
# Applied to
255.255.255.0
# The result is:
129.144.41.0
```
**In binary form, the operation is:**

```console
  10000001.10010000.00101001.01100101  # IPv4 address [AND] Netmask
# |||||||| |||||||| |||||||| ||||||||
  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 
# |||||||| |||||||| |||||||| ||||||||
# vvvvvvvv vvvvvvvv vvvvvvvv vvvvvvvv
  10000001.10010000.00101001.00000000  # 129.144.41.0/24
```

### :zero::six: **What are the differences between public and private IPs?**

Public Ip  can to be static or dynamic.
 - A static address is unchanged and is often for hosting websites, server.
 - A dynamic address are chasen from a "pool" of available addresses and will be changed each time user connects.

### :zero::seven: **What is a class of IP addresses?**

IP address in class **A**, class **B** and class **C**.

| Class	|  Starting IP address	| Ending Ip Address|  Number of Host | 
--------|-----------------------|------------------|------------| 
|  A 	| 10.0.0.0		| 10.255.255.255   | 16,777,216 |
|  B 	| 172.16.0.0		| 172.31.255.255   | 1,048,576  |
|  C 	| 192.168.0.0		| 192.168.255.255  | 65,536     |

### :zero::eight: **What is TCP?**

TCP (Transmision Control Protocol)
Main protocols of the internet protol suite.

- Keeps track of lost packages, makes sure that lost packages are re-sent
- Addes sequesce numbers to packets and reorders any packets that arrive in thenworng order.
- Slower, because of all added additional functionality.
- Requieres more computer resources, because the OS needs to keep track of ongoing communication sessions and manage them on a much deeper level.

### :zero::nine: **What is UDP?**

- Doesn't keep track of lost packages
- Doesn't care about package arrival order.
- Faster, bacause it lacks any extra features.
- Requieres less computer resources.
- Examples of programs and services that use UPD:
	- DNS
	- IP telephony
	- DHCP
	- Many computer games

**Why we use UDP?**

Many applications that requiere real-time communication prefer to use UDP, applications that requiere speed and that torerat partial data loss.

### :keycap_ten: **What are the network layers?**

In the seven-layer OSI model of computer network, the network layer is layer 3. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.

### :one::one: **What is the OSI model?**

The Open System Interconnection (OSI). It has been developed by ISO - 'International Organization of Standardization'. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All tese 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data fr4om one person to another across the globe.

 | Layer		| Kind	         |
 |----------------------|----------------|
 | Application Layer	| software layer |
 | Presentatation layer	| software layer |
 | Session Layer	| software layer |
 | Transport Layer	| Heart of OSI   |
 | Network Layer	| hardware Layer |
 | Data Link Layer	| hardware Layer |
 | Physical layer	| hardware Layer |


### :one::two: **What is a DHCP server and the DHCP protocol**
 
 DHCP server: DHCP (Dynamic Host Confivguration Protocol), is a protocol that provides quick, automatic, and central management for the distribution of IP addresses within a network. DHCP is also used to configure  the subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server information on the device.

### :one::three: **What is a DNS server and the DNS protocol?**

Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of internet. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources.

The **Domain Network System (DNS) protocol** helps internet users and network devises discover websites using human-readable hostnames, instead of  numeric IP addresses.

### :one::four: **What are the rules to make 2 devices communicate using IP addresses?**

### :one::five: **How does routing work with IP?**

- Routing is the process by which data packets move from one node (machine or device) to another on a computer network until the packets reach the final destination.

The header information includes:
- The IP addresses of the source and destination nodes.
- Packet numbers that help reassemble the packets in the correct order whe  the packets reach the destination. 
- Other useful technical information.

### :one::six: **What is a default gateway for routing?**

 It allows devices within one network to send information to devises within another network. If you are requestiong a certain web page, the trafic is first sent to your default gateay before leaving the local network to reach its indended destination.

### :one::seven: **What is a port from an IP point of view and what is it used for when connecting?**

In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. 
 Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. The most common protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
